# Docker Gemini Portal

A crude docker implementation of [michael-lazar/gemini-portal](https://github.com/michael-lazar/gemini-portal)

This can and should be optimized and improved upon. I know very little about coding.

## How to run it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Parole3640/docker-gemini-portal.git
docker build -t gemini-portal .
docker run -p 5000:5000 gemini-portal
```
